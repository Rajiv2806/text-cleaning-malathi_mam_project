Every customer is carefully evaluated to establish a credit limit we believe is consistent with Volt's threshold criteria for credit worthiness. We have established $45,000 as credit limit and believe it is appropriate. Due to the past due, the customer is near or over credit limit, please review and respond if you anticipate business increase?    The policy requires a New Customer Profile be submitted for credit approval before assignment is placed, if adding business on existing customers. This will ensure client is not placed on No Adds Hold due to exceeding credit limit and/or non-payment.  Thank you for your help.

Though our research, we have provided the time cards and documentation.    Please short pay the invoice by 18.00, the employee Manuel Rodriquez did not start work at CTDI and we should not have billed the 18.00 drug testing fee.  I will dispute and request our Billing Team credit from the invoice.  Please pay 46078.22 for Invoice #34354295    Please see the attached time cards for  1. Manuel Rodriguez was billed for Drug Test. I cannot find this temporary associate at all in Kronos within a 6 month range (June to Dec). W/e date on invoice has 9/25/16, please short pay by 18.00, Volt should not have billed for the employee that did not start at CTDI.    2.

REUTERS/Toru Hanai  More  TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of Toshiba Corp tumbled as much as 5.8 percent in early trade on Monday after a newspaper report that some trust banks are preparing to sue the company for damages.  The Asahi Shimbun reported that several trust banks including Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corp [MTFGTB.UL] are set to sue Toshiba after its share price tanked due to a massive accounting scandal that has upended the company.  On Friday, Toshiba said it would sell a minority stake in its memory chip business as it urgently seeks funds to offset an imminent multi-billion dollar writedown on its U.S. nuclear business. It said the overseas nuclear division was now under review.  The Nikkei business daily separately reported over the weekend that Chairman Shigenori Shiga was ready to step down to take responsibility.

The customer will not pay any invoices with OT on them. I talked to Tina at 714-436-1330 and she said all employees take a 1 hr lunch, except Tuafafo opted to take 1/2hr lunches and 2, 15 minute breaks. A payroll correction needs to be submitted and he needs to be talked to about the way he completes his timecard. See attached.

She also sd they are in process of getting refinancing but would not disclose further details and sd once that happens, they should get caught up/current.

I also just got off the phone with customer regarding remaining past due balance and she said they will try to pay us 2-3 invoices per week until they get caught up. They also said they are in the process of getting refinancing this week or next week and thinks once that happens, they will get current (I asked what kind of refinancing but would not disclose). I emphasized the importance of payments coming in consistently every week to avoid disruption of service or having to pull our temp from assignment.    Please let me know if you still want to discuss pulling EE from assignment since the customer has promised this payment arrangement before and has not kept their promise of sending us weekly payments or if you want me to continue to monitor for payments.

The attached rates provided by the branch have different effective dates so they will vary depending on week ending date that is in dispute. For example, some of the employees had rate increases so in some cases the rate will be lower one week and higher the next weeks or vice versa.  Attached is excel spreadsheet of everything that is open to help with the rebills after the branch edits the notes In VT. I have noted the correct rates next to each invoice and week ending date for each item that is in dispute under column N including the employees listed below so Frances can update the rates in the VT note column. Also, everything in yellow has been disputed (please see dispute number under column M). I will be disputing everything else highlighted in green that customer recently confirmed is incorrect. I have noted the correct rates as well under column N. The items highlighted in blue have incorrect hours billed and I have noted the correct amount of hours that should have billed next to those items.    I am also attaching a copy of the contract related to the rates and how we should be calculating them if questions.
Frances/Scott or Chris,    Hello. Can you confirm the DT rates below are correct for EE Sakez and EE Ahumada? Please also see attached excel spreadsheet for correct rates that we need you to manually update in the Volt Track notes so the credit/rebill team can revise. Apparently the rates cannot be updated in Volt Track because these employees have ended their assignment however we were told the branch can revise in the Volt Track note column. Please see column “L” and advise if you are able to do this so our credit/rebill team can revise these invoices.

Toshiba Will Spin Off Memory-Chip Unit at End of March    New York, 1/27/2017 (CRM) -- The following is an excerpt from a story published by MarketWatch:    Toshiba Corp. will spin off its computer memory-chip unit at the end of March, the company said Friday, in an effort by the cash-strapped industrial conglomerate to raise fresh capital for the businesses that require large investments.    “The spinoff would enable us to make prompt investment decisions and maximize the unit’s value,” Toshiba said.    The memory unit had ¥845.6 billion yen ($7.4 billion) in revenue during the fiscal year through March. Toshiba said it would consider a number of options for the unit to bring in capital, including a possible cash infusion by external parties.    Toshiba fell into a deep financial crisis due to substantial cost overruns at nuclear power plant construction projects in the U.S. involving affiliate Westinghouse Electric Co. The company plans to announce a write-down amounting to billions of dollars on Feb. 14.

New York, 1/23/2017 (CRM) -- The following is an excerpt from a story published by The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette:    In the shadow of multibillion-dollar writedowns for its parent company and more of the same on the horizon, Westinghouse Electric Co. has scrapped a plan to acquire a nuclear safety equipment company in Texas.    The Cranberry-based nuclear power firm had announced in October that it would buy Nuclear Logistics LLC from that company’s Texas-based parent AZZ Inc. A swift closing was expected, but months of negotiations spelled trouble for the deal.    AZZ’s CEO Tom Ferguson told investors earlier this month that “uncertainty in the nuclear markets” was dragging on negotiations.    Noelle Dilts, an equity analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, believes that was code referring to Westinghouse parent company Toshiba’s announcement in late December that it expects to take a writedown on the value of the Cranberry company worth several billions of dollars, stemming from its 2015 acquisition of a nuclear construction firm.    Toshiba hasn’t arrived at a number yet — “At this moment, the figures are still subject to determination, and measures against the possible impact are under study,” Toshiba said in a statement Thursday — but some estimates have gone as high as $6 billion, a result of higher than estimated costs for Westinghouse’s new reactor projects in Georgia and South Carolina.

The customer confirmed employee never showed up so we should not have billed this background check to them.  Can you follow up with branch and have them confirm if customer is correct and if we need to credit this invoice? If you go to collection notes from credit department for this customer and select customer profile, credit information tab, then attachments, it will bring up the NCP (customer/branch profile).  This is what the NCP looks like. I usually use this when there is not a lot of notes and account was set up recently. Attached is email from customer if you want to forward to branch and ask them how they want to proceed or if we need to credit. If they confirm we need to credit, you will need to create a dispute in Emagia and assign to SAS credit/rebill team.

Thanks.      ---------------------------
Recommendation  Customer is a private company without published financials. However, D&B reports that for YE 2010 they had sales of $5.9M and working capital of $1.7M. Credit is limited but OK. PAYDEX is 64, with mostly positive pay reported. DBT index is 9, also with mostly positive pay reported, even though in December 2016 half of trades reported past due balances. FSR score is low risk at 100, and has been above 90 for the last 12 months. With Volt since December 2014, pay record seems good. Volume of business is low. Originally approved for 15 people, there is currently only one person out on assignment. Total billed/paid in one year is $61K. Credit line could be reconsidered.

Email from Nick indicates there is about $57K of the older items paying on the next check run. The remaining items are finally approved and he is pushing for payment date. The delay was caused because we billed multiple projects on the same invoice and they had to be revised. Nick confirmed that the current invoices are correct.

It looks like it was just keyed in wrong in our system. Is it fine if I create a credit memo with the same invoice number in the amount of $371.14 and apply it to our next payment? It also looks like we also have a credit of $146.59 on our account. Is that correct?

Every customer is carefully evaluated to establish a credit limit we believe is consistent with Volt's threshold criteria for credit worthiness. We have established $50k as credit limit and believe it is appropriate. Due to the past due, the customer is near or over credit limit, please review and respond if you anticipate business increase?    The policy requires a New Customer Profile be submitted for credit approval before assignment is placed, if adding business on existing customers. This will ensure client is not placed on No Adds Hold due to exceeding credit limit and/or non-payment.  Thank You,    Modesta Perez  Credit Manager     Volt Information Sciences, Inc.

We are not being paid by suppliers servicing this customer for our admin fee.  Many suppliers were taken off the program due to non-payment a few years ago.  The ones left are the largest suppliers AT&T needs.  At the time, we supported this business because of the larger domestic business from AT&T which is slowly but surely ending.

Please note the head on the last attached email as the week-ending as 12/4, which is wrong, as these invoices are for 12/11.    The first 4 underlined invoices do belong to the Bunzl KC 37 branch, and I have forwarded those invoices on to them. The other ones you underlined are for your location and those invoices are included. They are for Curtis Ricks, Cody Goodwin, Doug Newsome, Dolphin Davis and Commanche Wade. There is also an invoice (34555281) for Commanche billed to location 37 in error, so I also attached that invoice.    I had also resubmitted the 11/27 and 12/4 invoices to AP, as they did not have record of them; I would suspect they didn’t have record of them since you hadn’t received them.    Please let me know if there is anything else you need.
