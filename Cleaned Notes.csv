REUTERS/Toru Hanai  More  TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of Toshiba Corp tumbled as much as 5.8 percent in early trade on Monday after a newspaper report that some trust banks are preparing to sue the company for damages.  The Asahi Shimbun reported that several trust banks including Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corp [MTFGTB.UL] are set to sue Toshiba after its share price tanked due to a massive accounting scandal that has upended the company.  On Friday, Toshiba said it would sell a minority stake in its memory chip business as it urgently seeks funds to offset an imminent multi-billion dollar writedown on its U.S. nuclear business. It said the overseas nuclear division was now under review.  The Nikkei business daily separately reported over the weekend that Chairman Shigenori Shiga was ready to step down to take responsibility.

Toshiba Will Spin Off Memory-Chip Unit at End of March    New York, 1/27/2017 (CRM) -- The following is an excerpt from a story published by MarketWatch:    Toshiba Corp. will spin off its computer memory-chip unit at the end of March, the company said Friday, in an effort by the cash-strapped industrial conglomerate to raise fresh capital for the businesses that require large investments.    “The spinoff would enable us to make prompt investment decisions and maximize the unit’s value,” Toshiba said.    The memory unit had ¥845.6 billion yen ($7.4 billion) in revenue during the fiscal year through March. Toshiba said it would consider a number of options for the unit to bring in capital, including a possible cash infusion by external parties.    Toshiba fell into a deep financial crisis due to substantial cost overruns at nuclear power plant construction projects in the U.S. involving affiliate Westinghouse Electric Co. The company plans to announce a write-down amounting to billions of dollars on Feb. 14.

407,"New York, 1/23/2017 (CRM) -- The following is an excerpt from a story published by The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette:    In the shadow of multibillion-dollar writedowns for its parent company and more of the same on the horizon, Westinghouse Electric Co. has scrapped a plan to acquire a nuclear safety equipment company in Texas.    The Cranberry-based nuclear power firm had announced in October that it would buy Nuclear Logistics LLC from that company’s Texas-based parent AZZ Inc. A swift closing was expected, but months of negotiations spelled trouble for the deal.    AZZ’s CEO Tom Ferguson told investors earlier this month that “uncertainty in the nuclear markets” was dragging on negotiations.    Noelle Dilts, an equity analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, believes that was code referring to Westinghouse parent company Toshiba’s announcement in late December that it expects to take a writedown on the value of the Cranberry company worth several billions of dollars, stemming from its 2015 acquisition of a nuclear construction firm.    Toshiba hasn’t arrived at a number yet — “At this moment, the figures are still subject to determination, and measures against the possible impact are under study,” Toshiba said in a statement Thursday — but some estimates have gone as high as $6 billion, a result of higher than estimated costs for Westinghouse’s new reactor projects in Georgia and South Carolina.

The customer confirmed employee never showed up so we should not have billed this background check to them.  Can you follow up with branch and have them confirm if customer is correct and if we need to credit this invoice? If you go to collection notes from credit department for this customer and select customer profile, credit information tab, then attachments, it will bring up the NCP (customer/branch profile).  This is what the NCP looks like. I usually use this when there is not a lot of notes and account was set up recently. Attached is email from customer if you want to forward to branch and ask them how they want to proceed or if we need to credit. If they confirm we need to credit, you will need to create a dispute in Emagia and assign to SAS credit/rebill team.

VCG - (Corp. #9453559)    Hi Modesta,    Please see the attached basic review per your request.  Thanks.      Recommendation  Customer is a private company without published financials. Credit is good. Per D&B report, PAYDEX is 76 with positive pay reported. DBT index is 9 with some over 90 but mostly positive pay reported. FSR score is low-medium risk at 42. NACM predictive score is low risk at 2, per 12 months of historical trade data. In business with Volt since 1990 through Volt's VWS and VCG divisions, there are 3 active sub-accounts under VCG. Open balance under VCG is $1.4M, with a past due of $78K. Our exposure through VWS is under corporate #9432665 with separate credit line of $1M, and a lower A/R of $64K. Pay record with Volt is OK. Per VCG's billing, we are invoicing an average of $2.2M per month, which they expect to increase in the next few months. Credit line could be reconsidered to support volume of business.    -----------------------------------","rr credit review credit utilization report ramiro rivas linda urieta taylor corp vcg corp attached basic review request recommendation customer private company published financials credit report paydex positive pay reported dbt index positive pay reported fsr score low medium risk nacm predictive score low risk months historical trade data business vws vcg divisions active accounts vcg open balance vcg past due exposure vws corporate separate credit line lower pay record vcg billing invoicing average month expect increase months credit line reconsidered support volume business"
